Given the codebase shown in the context above (with filenames as headings), please list a set of potential improvements or optimizations that could enhance the code's performance, readability, maintainability, or adherence to best practices. I would like to understand the reasons for each suggested improvement and how they can be implemented.

Options:

Explain and Apply One by One: Provide a detailed explanation for each improvement, and wait for my input on whether to apply each one before proceeding to the next.

Apply All at Once: Apply all the suggested improvements at once, with a brief explanation of why each change is beneficial.

Selective Implementation: List all the improvements and allow me to choose which ones to apply. For the selected ones, provide detailed implementation steps.

General Explanation: Provide a high-level explanation of why each improvement would be beneficial, along with brief instructions on how to implement them without making changes directly.

Please proceed based on the option you think best suits the nature of the improvements you will suggest, or if unsure, ask for my preference before proceeding.
